EEG analysis tool for Matlab. eegtool is a program that facilitates certain types of EEG analyses.
The program uses eeglab as a base and in many cases the features of eegtool are wrapping eeglab
functions.

eegtool consists of two main parts:
* eegtoolPreprocess - preprocessing EEG on a visually pleasing GUI or through scripting API.

Transferring project codes to github in progress. Some features may be missing or not work like expected yet.
The latest major updates to eegtool are few years ago.
